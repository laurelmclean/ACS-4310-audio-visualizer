# ACS 4310 Audio Visualizer

This project is an audio visualizer built with JavaScript, where real-time audio data is displayed using a canvas. The visualizer takes an array of audio frequency data and transforms it into a visual representation on the canvas. The audio used is a song called Denigrate by Calgary band I Am The Mountain.

## Questions Answered by the Visualization

1. What is the rhythm and tempo of the song "Denigrate" by I Am The Mountain?
The audio visualizer can potentially convey the rhythm and tempo of the song through visual cues. Understanding how the visualizer represents the beat, pulse, or rhythmic patterns can provide insights into the synchronization between the audio and the visual elements.

2. Are there any notable changes in the dynamic range of the audio?
The dynamic range of the audio refers to the difference between the quietest and loudest parts of the sound. The audio visualizer can potentially display changes in amplitude or intensity over time, allowing you to observe the dynamic range variations. Identifying peaks, drops, or other significant changes in the visual representation can aid in audio mixing, mastering, or identifying the expressive elements in the music.

3. How are the different energy levels, sectins, and moods of the song "Denigrate" by I Am The Mountain portrayed?
The audio visualizer can potentially convey the energy levels of the song through visual cues. Exploring the visual representation on the canvas can provide insights into how the visualizer portrays the song's dynamic changes, highlighting energetic or subdued sections.
