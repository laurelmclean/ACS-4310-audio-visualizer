# ACS 4310 Audio Visualizer

This project is an audio visualizer built with JavaScript, where real-time audio data is displayed using a canvas. The visualizer takes an array of audio frequency data and transforms it into a visual representation on the canvas. The audio used is a song called Denigrate by Calgary band I Am The Mountain.
